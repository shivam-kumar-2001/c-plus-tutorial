 *** Object oriented programming - A programming approach which follows concept of object oriented programming like class, object 
       , data abstraction & encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism etc, is known as Object oriented programming...
 
***Object --  An object is a real world entity which has its name and own properties. For example- apple is an object 
and its properties are name, color, size and taste etc, like..

The basic concepts of object oriented programming are:
1..Object
2..Class
3..Inheritance
4..Data Abstraction
5..Data Encapsulation
6..Polymorphism

 ***OBJECT  -- An object is an instance of a class. Object is one of the basic elements of OOPâ€™s; it is most significant unit 
as without creating object, we cannot access the functionality of the class. After defining the class, we create 
its object to get accessibility of data member and member functions of respective class.
Syntax:
class_name object_name  ...

CLASS  -- Class is a user define data type; we call it user define because a user can define the data and 
   functions as per their requirements
   
yntax

    class class_name
    {
      //data members section
      private:
         ...;                             
         ...;
   
      // member functions section
      public:
         ...;
         ...;
    };
    
    eg...
    
    #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class student
{	
	private:
		//sname and srollno are data members
		char sname [30];
		int    srollno;

		public:
			void getinput()
			{
				// get name from the Keyboard 
				cout<<"Input Students Name: ";  
				cin>>sname;
				
				// get rollno from the Keyboard
				cout<<"Input Students Roll Number: ";
				cin>>srollno;	          
			}
			void getoutput()
			{
				// shows name on monitor
				cout<<"Students Name:"<< sname << endl;     
				// shows rollno on monitor
				cout<<"Student Roll Number:"<<srollno<< endl;   
			}
};

//main code
int main()
{
	// s is an object of student class
	student s;                  

	// the getinput method is being called
	s.getinput();             
	
	// the getoutput method is being called
	s.getoutput();
	
	return 0;
}
Output

Input Students Name: DUGGU 
Input Students Roll Number: 101 
Students Name:DUGGU
Student Roll Number:101
