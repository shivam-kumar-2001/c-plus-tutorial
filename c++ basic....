c++..
C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, 
object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc

extension :: .CPP, .C, .CP...

NOTE ::  The two keywords cout and cin are used very often for taking inputs and printing outputs.

NOTE** The #include directive tells the compiler to include a file and #include<iostream> . It tells the compiler to include
        the standard iostream file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions.
        
***  using namespace std: This is used to import the entirety of the std namespace into the current namespace of the program..
    The std namespace is huge. The alternative to this statement is to specify the namespace to which the identifier belongs 
    using the scope operator(::) each time we declare a type.
   
*** int main(): This line is used to declare a function named “main” which returns data of integer type. A function is a 
    group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task..
    
**** { and }: The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates 
    the ending of the main function. Everything between these two comprises the body of the main function.
    
***  return 0; : This is also a statement. This statement is used to return a value from a function and indicates the 
finishing of a function. This statement is basically used in functions to return the results of the operations performed by a function.

***  Preprocessors are programs that process our source code before compilation.

*** All of these preprocessor directives begin with a ‘#’ (hash) symbol. The ‘#’ symbol indicates that, whatever statement start with #,
is going to preprocessor program, and preprocessor program will execute this statement. Examples of some 
preprocessor directives are: #include, #define, #ifndef etc. Remember
that # symbol only provides a path that it will go to preprocessor, and command such as include is processed by preprocessor program..

***There are 4 main types of preprocessor directives:
1..Macros
2..File Inclusion
3..Conditional Compilation
4..Other directives

*** Macros: Macros are a piece of code in a program which is given some name. Whenever this name is encountered by the compiler the
compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code. The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro

File Inclusion: This type of preprocessor directive tells the compiler to include a file in the source code program.
There are two types of files which can be included by the user in the program:

Header File or Standard files: These files contains definition of pre-defined functions like printf(), scanf() etc.
These files must be included for working with these functions. Different function are declared in different header files.
For example standard I/O funuctions are in ‘iostream’ file whereas functions which perform string operations are in ‘string’ file.
Syntax:  #include< file_name >

user defined files: When a program becomes very large, it is good practice to divide it into smaller files and include whenever needed.
These types of files are user defined files. These files can be included as:
#include"filename"...

** Conditional Compilation: Conditional Compilation directives are type of directives which helps to compile a specific portion of 
the program or to skip compilation of some specific part of the program based on some conditions. This can be done with the help of 
two preprocessing commands ‘ifdef‘ and ‘endif‘.

****   We can encapsulate multiple classes into single namespace. Here, std is a namespace and :: (Scope Resolution Operator) is 
used to access member of namespace. And we include namespace std in our C++ program so that there is no need to put std:: explicitly 
into program to use cout and other related things.   ****

***Keywords  -- The reserved words of C++ may be conveniently placed into several groups..

    auto   const     double  float  int       short   struct   unsigned
    break  continue  else    for    long      signed  switch   void
    case   default   enum    goto   register  sizeof  typedef  volatile

 *** Identifiers  ---  Identifiers refers to the name of variables, functions, arrays, 
    classes, etc. created by the user. Identifiers are the fundamental requirement of any language. 

*** Identifier naming conventions :::
   Only alphabetic characters, digits and underscores are permitted.
    First letter must be an alphabet or underscore (_).
    Identifiers are case sensitive.
     Reserved keywords can not be used as an identifier's name.  
     
 ***Constants  ---  Constants refers to fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.

    Declaration of a constant  :
    const [data_type] [constant_name]=[value];
    
 *** Variable  ---  variable is a meaningful name of data storage location in computer memory. When 
 using a variable you refer to memory address of computer.
